-👋 Hi, I’m @Shivam Singh!

- 👀 I’m interested in AWS DevOps and love simplifying networking concepts!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DevOps, which is like being a chef in the kitchen of software development, blending ingredients (tools) like AWS, Docker, and Jenkins to create amazing dishes (applications).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where I can cook up some innovative solutions using my AWS and DevOps skills.
- 📫 You can reach me through direct messages here on LinkedIn(www.linkedin.com/in/shivam-pratap-singh-88332717b).
- 😄 Pronouns: HE, HIM
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that even though the internet is made of information and seems weightless, it actually has a tiny bit of weight? The energy used by servers and data transmission adds up to about the weight of a strawberry!
- It's fascinating to think about how our digital world has a tiny physical presence too!
